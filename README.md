# Cyber Lab Workflow
This repository documents lab configurations, security hardening steps, and testing best practices for bastion and monitoring environments.

This project will branch into other hardening and testing environments.
Examples include hardening apt-cache repositories, SFTP, FTP-S, and Access points.

The idea is to harden/configure, test, document, verify, while keeping detailed and accurate documentation of the results and hardening process.
